<p>If you'd like to copy my gdocs spreadsheets (with highlighting and formatting already there) you can use the links below.
Note that you'll still have to tweak both scripts as described in the instructions but otherwise these should be ready to go.  Just make a copy of these files when logged into your google account and they should appear on your Google Drive.
