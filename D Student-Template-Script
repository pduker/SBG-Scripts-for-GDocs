// getting the total number of categories - This needs to be a formula on the last row of the master
// spreadsheet that counts the categories; something like "=(Counta(1:1)) - 2" (or you could simply 
// put the number here if it has already been determined).

// there's a simpler solution?

// clearing away any previous data so that it is a clean re-write in case you've deleted or changed
// any of your categories.  Note if you see yourself deleting more than 5 categories you'll want to 
// update the number below to be more than 5 (e.g. if you might delete 7 categories you'll want the 
// next line to read:
//  displayPage.getRange(2,2,numcategories,assignments.length + 7).clear({contentsOnly:true});
// The only con with this is that it creates extra blank columns on the student gradebook, which
// isn't too big of a deal

  displayPage.getRange(2,2,numcategories,assignments.length + 5).clear({contentsOnly:true});

// re-pull the categories from the master (this and the last function allows for a set of categories that
// can grow and shrink over time).  This pastes the categories so that it matches those on the
// "Average" sheet in the master spreadsheet 

  var categories = mastersheet.getRange(1,3,1,numcategories).getValues();  
  displayPage.getRange(1,2,1,numcategories).setValues(categories);
  
// this is where it goes through each page of the master spreadsheet and starts to pull data for the 
// student gradebook. It first pulls the assignment name and pastes into the first column (A) of the student
// gradebook.  Then it pulls the student scores and pastes them into the student gradebook as well.  

  for(var r=0;r<assignments.length;r++){
    var assignmentname = assignments[r].getName();  
    displayPage.getRange(r+2,1).setValue(assignmentname);
    var assignmentsheet = assignments[r]; 
    var assignmentdata = assignmentsheet.getRange(studentrow,3,1,numcategories).getValues();
    for(var dp=0;dp<assignmentdata[0].length;dp++){
      var targetcol = dp+2;
      var targetrow = r+2;
      displayPage.getRange(targetrow,targetcol).setValue(assignmentdata[0][dp])
    }
